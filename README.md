# Sudoku Solver

## Description
This project is a **Sudoku Solver** that allows users to play Sudoku and solve puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The solver takes an incomplete Sudoku grid and fills in the missing numbers, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Sudoku Board**: Allows users to enter numbers into the Sudoku grid.
- **Auto-Solve**: Solve any valid Sudoku puzzle instantly using the backtracking algorithm.
- **Validation**: Ensures that each row, column, and sub-grid adheres to Sudoku rules.
- **Recursive Backtracking**: Uses an efficient algorithm to find solutions by filling the grid cell by cell.

## Key Algorithms
- **Backtracking**: A recursive algorithm that tries to place numbers in empty cells while adhering to Sudoku rules. It backtracks whenever it encounters a violation until a solution is found or the puzzle is proven unsolvable.

## Skills Developed
- **Recursive Problem-Solving**: Implement recursive functions to solve complex constraint-based problems.
- **Constraints Handling**: Develop logic to manage Sudoku's unique row, column, and sub-grid constraints.
- **Game Logic**: Create and manage a dynamic game board that updates based on user input and algorithm output.
